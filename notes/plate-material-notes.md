# Plate Material Notes

Various notes about plate materials pulled from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bhutqj/brass_polycarbonate_or_carbon_fiber_plate/) reddit post.

- for feel, tactile/clicky switches reportedly feel better in a plate with give like poly or carbon or aluminium
- for linears steel or brass
- for sound, clicky switches sound slightly bassier on brass, higher pitched on aluminium, slightly muted on poly carb.
