# PocketType!

Standard setup for the [PocketType!](https://mechboards.co.uk/shop/kits/pockettype/) mini keyboard.

The `keymap` directory contains the keyboard layout and were created by [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/). Please note: the zmk keymap is slightly adjusted from the default shown on the main PocketType! pages and QMK.
