# TG4X

Standard setup for the [TG4X](https://github.com/MythosMann/tg4x/) 40% keyboard.

The `keymap` directory contains the keyboard layout and were created by [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/). Please note: the zmk keymap is slightly adjusted from the default shown on the main TG4X pages and QMK.
